//A Competitor is an object of any class that implements Competitor
//
//Interpretation: the competitor represents an individual or team
//  that may have engaged in one or more contests

//Note:  In Java, you cannot assume a List is mutable, because all
//of the List operations that change the state of a List are optional.
//Mutation of a Java list is allowed only if a precondition or other
//invariant says the list is mutable and you are allowed to change it.

import java.util.List;

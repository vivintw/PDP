I hereby certify that all the work in this commit is my own except for 
materials distributed as part of this class.
/* do not change the format of anything above this line */

After each work session, please edit and commit this file, updating the
first two lines with the amount of time you spent working and the date
when you stopped.  You may also record any notes you wish to make about
what you did during the session.

Every commit of this file constitutes a work log entry.  Each entry
should replace the previous one, so there will only be one session
recorded at any particular version of this file.  Do *not* change the
format of the first four lines, as the course staff will use
automated tools to track the amount of time students spend on each
problem set.
